    "### 🎓 Lecture: The Logic of Deduplication (DELETE vs. SELECT)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a Senior Data Professional, writing a `SELECT` statement to find duplicates is safe. Writing a `DELETE` statement based on joins is **high-risk**. If you mess up the logic, you lose data permanently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. The \"Keep\" vs. \"Kill\" Strategy\n",
    "There are two mental models for solving this:\n",
    "1.  **The \"Kill\" Strategy (Self-Join):** Identify explicitly the rows that are redundant (e.g., \"Find rows where the email is the same, but the ID is larger\").\n",
    "2.  **The \"Keep\" Strategy (Window/Aggregate):** Identify the \"Golden Records\" (e.g., \"Find the minimum ID for every email\") and delete everything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Visualizing the Comparison (Cross Join Logic)\n",
    "To understand the \"Kill\" strategy, imagine comparing every row with every other row.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ASCII Matrix of Comparison:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Row A (id:1, john)  vs  Row B (id:3, john)\n",
    "    ------------------------------------------\n",
    "    1. Are emails same?  YES (john@example.com)\n",
    "    2. Is A.id > B.id?   NO  (1 is not > 3)\n",
    "    -> Conclusion: Row A is the \"original\". Don't delete.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Row B (id:3, john)  vs  Row A (id:1, john)\n",
    "    ------------------------------------------\n",
    "    1. Are emails same?  YES\n",
    "    2. Is B.id > A.id?   YES (3 > 1)\n",
    "    -> Conclusion: Row B is the \"duplicate\". DELETE IT.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. SQL Syntax Variations (Important for Interviews)\n",
    "This specific LeetCode problem is infamous because the solution syntax varies heavily between SQL Dialects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. The MySQL Syntax (LeetCode Default):**\n",
    "MySQL allows joining tables *inside* the DELETE statement.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE p1\n",
    "FROM Person p1, Person p2\n",
    "WHERE p1.email = p2.email AND p1.id > p2.id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation:** \"Delete from alias p1 if it matches p2 on email, but p1 has the larger ID.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**B. The ANSI SQL Syntax (Postgres, SQLite, Oracle):**\n",
    "Standard SQL often forbids joining in the DELETE clause. You must use a Subquery.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE FROM Person\n",
    "WHERE id NOT IN (\n",
    "    SELECT MIN(id)\n",
    "    FROM Person\n",
    "    GROUP BY email\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** \"Calculate the list of IDs we want to SAVE (the minimums). Delete everyone else.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Safely Running DELETEs in Production\n",
    "In a real job, NEVER run a DELETE directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run as SELECT first: SELECT * FROM Person WHERE ... to verify what will be gone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Transactions:** BEGIN TRANSACTION; DELETE ...; ROLLBACK; (or COMMIT).\n",
    "\n",
    "Soft Deletes: Often, we don't actually delete. We verify a column is_deleted = true."

    "### Step-by-Step Reasoning for the Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are running this notebook in **SQLite**, we will use the **ANSI SQL** standard approach (The \"Keep\" Strategy). It is more robust and universally understood than the MySQL-specific join syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logical Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Identify the Keepers:** We want to group records by `email` and find the `MIN(id)` for each group.\n",
    "    *   Query: `SELECT MIN(id) FROM Person GROUP BY email`\n",
    "    *   Result: `[1, 2]` (John's ID 1, Bob's ID 2).\n",
    "2.  **Identify the Targets:** Any ID that is **NOT IN** this list of keepers must be a duplicate with a higher ID.\n",
    "3.  **Perform Deletion:** Delete rows where the `id` is not in the \"Keeper List\".\n",

    "### Summary and Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Destructive Operations:** Always treat `DELETE` with extreme caution. In this notebook, we used the \"Keep Strategy\" (Keep MIN ID), which is safer because it explicitly defines the \"Golden Records\" first.\n",
    "2.  **Syntax Differences:** Be aware that `DELETE p1 FROM p1 JOIN p2` is specific to MySQL (and T-SQL with variation). The `WHERE id NOT IN (...)` pattern works on almost every relational database (SQLite, Postgres, Oracle).\n",
    "3.  **Self-Joins Logic:** Even though we used a subquery, the concept is fundamentally a self-comparison: comparing the set of IDs against the set of \"Best\" IDs for the same email.\n",
    "4.  **Edge Cases:**\n",
    "    *   **All Unique:** The `MIN(id)` list includes everyone. `NOT IN` excludes nothing. 0 rows deleted. Correct.\n",
    "    *   **Triple Duplicate:** If John had IDs 1, 3, 5. `MIN(id)` is 1. IDs 3 and 5 are NOT IN [1]. Both deleted. Correct."
