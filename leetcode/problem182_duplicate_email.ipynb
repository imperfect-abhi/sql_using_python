    "### 🎓 Lecture: Aggregation, Grouping, and The Order of Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "As a Senior Data Professional, identifying duplicates is 50% of your job in **ETL pipelines** (Extract, Transform, Load). Before loading data into a Production Data Warehouse, you must ensure referential integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, we rely on the **Split-Apply-Combine** strategy, implemented in SQL via `GROUP BY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. The Anatomy of Aggregation\n",
    "We cannot check for duplicates by looking at one row at a time. We must look at the **Set** of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Logic Flow:**\n",
    "1.  **Split:** Divide the table into buckets based on the `email` value.\n",
    "2.  **Apply:** Count the number of items in each bucket.\n",
    "3.  **Combine/Filter:** Return only the buckets where the count is $> 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. ASCII Visual: The Grouping Process\n",
    "\n",
    "    STEP 1: Original Table\n",
    "    +----+---------+\n",
    "    | id | email   |\n",
    "    +----+---------+\n",
    "    | 1  | a@b.com |\n",
    "    | 2  | c@d.com |\n",
    "    | 3  | a@b.com |\n",
    "\n",
    "    STEP 2: GROUP BY email (The \"Buckets\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Bucket 'a@b.com':  [ {id:1}, {id:3} ]\n",
    "    Bucket 'c@d.com':  [ {id:2} ]\n",
    "\n",
    "    STEP 3: AGGREGATE (Count rows in buckets)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    'a@b.com' -> Count: 2\n",
    "    'c@d.com' -> Count: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    STEP 4: FILTER (HAVING Count > 1)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    'a@b.com' -> KEEP (2 > 1)\n",
    "    'c@d.com' -> DROP (1 is not > 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. WHERE vs. HAVING (Crucial Concept)\n",
    "This is the #1 Interview Question for Junior/Mid SQL roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`WHERE` clause:** Filters rows *before* they are grouped.\n",
    "    *   *Can we use WHERE?* No. We don't know the count until *after* we group.\n",
    "    *   *Usage:* `WHERE email LIKE '%.com'` (This happens pre-aggregation).\n",
    "*   **`HAVING` clause:** Filters groups *after* aggregation is calculated.\n",
    "    *   *Usage:* `HAVING COUNT(id) > 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Relational Algebra\n",
    "In theoretical terms, this operation uses the **Grouping Operator** ($\\gamma$).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma_{count > 1} ( \\gamma_{email, COUNT(id)} (Person) ) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  $\\gamma$ (Gamma): Group by email.\n",
    "2.  $\\sigma$ (Sigma): Select/Filter where count > 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Alternative Approach: Self-Join\n",
    "While `GROUP BY` is preferred for performance ($O(N \\log N)$ or $O(N)$ with hashing), you *could* solve this with a self-join.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT p1.email\n",
    "FROM Person p1\n",
    "JOIN Person p2\n",
    "  ON p1.email = p2.email  -- Same email\n",
    " AND p1.id != p2.id       -- Different ID (meaning different physical row)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This logic says: \"Find me a row that matches another row on email, but isn't the same row.\"\n",
    "**Why avoid this?**\n",
    "##### Performance: It can create a huge number of intermediate rows if there are many duplicates (Cartesian explosion within the duplicate set).\n",
    "##### Readability: GROUP BY explicitly states intent (counting)."

    "### Step-by-Step Reasoning for the Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to extract emails appearing more than once.\n",

    "**Logical Steps:**\n",
    "1.  **Select Column:** We are interested in `email`.\n",

    "### Summary and Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The Pattern:** Finding duplicates is almost always solved with `GROUP BY [column] HAVING COUNT([column]) > 1`. Memorize this pattern.\n",
    "2.  **Execution Order:** Remember that `HAVING` runs after aggregation, while `WHERE` runs before. You cannot filter by a count in a `WHERE` clause.\n",
    "3.  **Data Quality:** In production, simply finding duplicates isn't enough. You usually need to *remove* them. That would require a more complex query (often using Window Functions like `ROW_NUMBER()`) to keep one instance (e.g., the one with the lowest ID) and delete the rest.\n",
    "4.  **Scalability:** Grouping operations are memory-intensive (the database builds a hash table). On massive datasets, ensure your grouping columns are indexed."
